## Miscellaneous thoughts

- Breeding bees
- split out new hives/extract a queen
- can move bees to a new hive with a hit to total population
- limit max number of hives (total or per species?)
- need to explore to find resources to craft new species???
- start with basic tools ala SDV
- different hives
	- standard tier upgrades
	- special breeding ones
	- special rare resource chance ones
	- etc
- you help farmers around you?
	- they might have rare crops so your bees have a chance of creating resources you cant get
	- initially they wont want fancy hives etc but over time when they see it helps you can put contraptions etc on their land
- risk of diseases etc
	- need preventative maintenance etc
- maybe have villager interaction/romance/friendships etc
- Tile/grid based layout, but free movement for entities within it
