## EARLY GAME

Focus: Core loops, player learning, basic rewards

System	Mechanic	Interaction / Loop
Hives	Place bees in slots	Produce honey/pollen based on number of bees
Breeding	Simple breeding mode	Small chance to produce additional bees
Exploration	Tile/grid exploration	Collect basic resources for hives and tools
Pollination	Farmer feedback	Crops indicate need for better bees
Marketplace	Sell hives/resources	Currency for new tools or hives

## MID GAME

Focus: Specialization, strategy, resource management

System	Mechanic	Interaction / Loop
Bee Traits	Productivity, lifespan, resistance	Breed for desired traits; mutations create new types
Environmental Adaptation	Biome, season, temperature effects	Move hives, craft upgrades for optimal performance
Diseases / Maintenance	Random events affecting hive	Craft treatments, manage risk
Hive Modules	Boosters, breeding chambers, pollination extenders	Upgrade hive for specialized loops
Resource-producing Bees	Iron, copper, rare essences	Craft materials or items from resources
NPC Relationships	Requests for specific bees/honey	Build friendship/rep for rewards, blueprints


## LATE GAME

Focus: Advanced systems, emergent gameplay, large-scale strategy

System	Mechanic	Interaction / Loop
Crossbreeding / Hybridization	Combine two/more types	Unlock rare/advanced species; requires conditions/materials
Bee Entities	Bees move/fly in world	Optional simulation outside hives for advanced gameplay
Hive Networks	Connect multiple hives	Automate resource flow and efficiency
Ecological Balance	Overuse reduces flower availability	Rotate hives, plant flowers, manage environment
Market / Factions	Guilds, contests, rare trades	Compete and trade for rare bees or rewards
Alchemy / High-end Crafting	Rare bee essences	Craft buffs, advanced items, or unique equipment

## INTERACTIONS

Source System	Affected System / Loop	Interaction / Effect
Hive (bees in slots)	Resource Production	Bees produce honey/pollen/metal based on slot occupation and bee type
Hive (bees in slots)	Breeding	Some bees trigger chance to create new bees in hive (mutation or crossbreed)
Hive Modules	Hive (bees in slots)	Modules modify production rate, breeding chance, or pollination radius
Bee Traits	Breeding	Determines offspring traits, mutation probabilities, rare species unlock
Environmental Conditions	Hive	Modifies bee productivity, survival, breeding chance (climate, biome, season)
Diseases / Parasites	Hive	Randomly reduce bee health, lower production, or kill bees
Player Actions	Hive	Add/remove bees, apply treatments, upgrade modules
Exploration / Resources	Hive	Allows crafting new hives, modules, or breeding materials
NPCs / Farmers	Hive / Player	Feedback drives breeding choices (pollination demand), trade of resources, reputation
Marketplace / Economy	Player	Sell hives/resources; unlock new materials or recipes
Crossbreeding / Hybridization	Bee Traits	Combines multiple bee types to unlock advanced species or special traits
Hive Networks / Automation	Resource Flow	Automates production across multiple hives; links loops together efficiently
Ecological Balance	Environment	Overuse of bees reduces flower/plant resources; affects future production loops
Alchemy / High-end Crafting	Player / Hives	Uses rare bee essences to craft powerful items or special upgrades

## Hive biomes and placement

### Zones / Biomes

Farm is divided into zones that define hive eligibility and progression:

Zone Type	Properties	Early / Mid / Late Game
Starter Meadow	Basic grass/dirt, few flowers	Early: supports standard bees
Forest Patch	More flowers, trees, rare wild bees	Mid: unlocks new species
Mountain Edge	Rocks, rare minerals	Mid/Late: supports metal-producing bees
Flower Gardens	High flower density, pollination bonus	Mid/Late: boosts output of specialized hives
Exotic Area	Restricted tiles, rare resources	Late: gated by quests, upgrades, or exploration

### Hive Placement Restrictions

Terrain restriction: Certain hives can only be placed on dirt or grass.

Zone restriction: Some hives require specific zones (rare/resource bees).

Obstacle clearance: Blocked tiles must be cleared first.

Adjacent effects: Optional — neighboring tiles can boost hive output (flower adjacency, modules nearby).

### Unlocking / Progression

Initial area: Only Starter Meadow is available.

Clearing mechanics: Axe/shovel or crafting removes obstacles → opens tiles.

Zone gating:

Unlock Forest Patch after reaching X bee types or NPC favor.

Unlock Mountain Edge after crafting certain hive modules or completing a quest.

Exotic Areas only accessible after collecting rare bees/resources.
